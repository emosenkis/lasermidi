# Lasermidi

This is a tool written in Rust to convert a MIDI file for use with a programmable music box. It can be used as a library, compiled as a standalone binary, or run directly in your browser (the web interface currently requires you to type in flags as if you were runninng it on the command line, but a more user-friendly interface would be a simple improvement).
